# Overview

This page describes the responses you may receive when sending CardPointe Gateway API requests, including HTTP errors and a detailed reference for authorization response codes. 

# HTTP Errors

HTTP errors are returned when the client (for example, the browser) encounters an issue communicating with the host server. 

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- 
| 400	| The server was unable to decipher the request because of invalid syntax. Update the request before repeating.
| 401	| The credentials passed in the request were not accepted by the server. Update the request before repeating.
| 404 | The endpoint url path specified in the request was incorrect.
| 500	| The host server encountered an issue and was unable to send a response.

# Response Codes

The CardPointe Gateway validates various parameters of a request prior to sending it to a payment card processor. For this internal validation, the card processor field (`respproc`) contains **PPS**.

If the request passes the internal validation, the request is forwarded to the appropriate payment processor based on the merchant ID, and the payment processor supplies the response values.

Each payment processor has a unique set of response codes. Generally, a processor response code (`respcode`) beginning with "00" or "000" is a successful authorization request. The `respstat` response indicates one of the following:

- A - Approval
- B - Temporary processing issue, such as a network error
- C - Rejection

## Gateway (PPS) Response Codes

The CardPointe Gateway validates various parameters of an authorization request prior to sending it to the payment card processor. The following response codes describe the approval and decline responses returned by the CardPointe Gateway. 

> The CardPointe Gateway does **not** validate the expiration date or automatically decline expired cards. Some issuers accept authorizations for expired cards; however, the issuer may decline an expired card based on its specific policies.

# Testing with Amount-Driven Response Codes

When testing your CardPointe Gateway or CardPointe Integrated Terminal integration in the UAT environment, you can use amount-driven response codes to emulate processor-specific authorization responses that you might encounter in the production environment. This allows you to receive and handle response codes that you would not otherwise encounter in your test environment.

See [Test Cases](../../docs/documentation/CardPointeGatewayDeveloperGuides.md#Test-Cases) in the [CardPointe Gateway API Developer Guides](../../docs/documentation/CardPointeGatewayDeveloperGuides.md) for detailed information on testing with amount-driven response codes and other useful test cases.
