# Overview

The CardPointe Unattended solution extends CardPointe Integrated Payments to unattended kiosk applications.

The CardPointe Unattended solution includes the following components:

- **Unattended card reader device** - The unattended device accepts EMV (chip), NFC (contactless), and MSR (magnetic stripe) payments, and connects via serial/USB to the host system and your client application.
- **Payment Application Engine** - The Payment Application Engine (PAE) provides the interface between your client application and the unattended device. Your application sends commands to the device to initiate the card reader, and securely capture the card data.
- **Web Payment Application** - The web payment application retrieves the encrypted card data from the device and initiates an authorization request to the CardPointe Gateway, via HTTP/Ethernet.
- **App Loader** - The app loader runs on the unattended device to check for and automatically download and install updates to the firmware, PAE, and SDK installed on the device.
- **CardPointe Gateway API** - The CardPointe Gateway API provides methods for managing and reporting on your transactions. Your application uses the CardPointe Gateway API to void, refund, or check the status of a transaction.

> Similarly to the CardPointe Integrated Terminal solution, your application **must** integrate the CardPointe Gateway API to manage transactions and perform other business functions. See the CardPointe Gateway API documentation for detailed information on integrating the CardPointe Gateway API.

## Features

The CardPointe Unattended solution offers a simple integration for retrieving encrypted payment card data from an unattended kiosk, tokenizing that data, and using the token to process a payment or refund on the CardPointe Gateway.

If you are currently integrating the CardPointe Integrated Terminal API for an attended payment solution, the CardPointe Unattended payment process is similar to a simplified authCard process.

For additional transaction management and reporting features, your application **must** use the CardPointe Gateway API to communicate directly with the CardPointe Gateway. See the CardPointe Gateway API for detailed information.

See Understanding Payment Flows, later in this guide for more information on making payment requests.

## Requirements

The unattended device requires the following connections:

- A Serial/USB connection to your application.
- An Ethernet connection to validate the device's configuration and to send payment requests to the CardPointe Gateway.
- A power connection using the included AC adapter. 

Your client application must:

- Run on a host system within the unattended kiosk.
- Send ASCII command strings to the unattended device over the Serial/USB connection.
- Send RESTful HTTP requests (for example, to void a transaction) to the CardPointe Gateway over a network (Ethernet or WiFi) connection.
- Retain the `processorReference` (the `retref`, or retrieval reference number, provided by the CardPointe Gateway and returned in the DPT response) in order to look up and manage, refund, or void payments.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> It is strongly recommended that you store the `processorReference` in a database table, which your application can use to manage transactions.

# Developer Resources

The following resources are available to help you integrate the CardPointe Unattended solution with your application.

## RS-232 Serial Drivers

Most workstations should support the serial-to-USB connection natively, without any additional drivers. If your workstation does not recognize the connected device, you may need to install a driver.

Visit the following site to download the necessary drivers for your operating system: 

https://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?pcid=41&showlevel=0017-0037-0041

## Serial Terminal Applications

To test the device connection and to send and receive data, you can use a serial terminal application.

The following serial terminal applications have been tested for use with the unattended device:

- For macOS: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/31352/coolterm
- For Windows: https://www.microridge.com/comtestserial.htm

Before you begin, note the name or number of the port that the device is connected to on your workstation. 

Additionally, configure the port configuration settings as follows:

- **Baudrate**: 115200
- **Data Bits**: 8
- **Parity**: None
- **Stop Bits**: 1

## Sample Checksum Calculator

As described in the CardPointe Unattended API, every command and response must include a checksum value. The checksum is derived from the CRC-16 decimal calculation of the ASCII command string up to and including the delimiter preceding the checksum field.

For testing, you can find a simple checksum calculator at crccalc.com.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> If using crccalc.com, ensure that you set the **Input type** to **ASCII**, **Output type** to **Decimal**, and click the **Calc CRC-16** button. The correct checksum value is displayed in the top-left corner of the results table (using the **CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE** algorithm).

Additionally, you can integrate the following sample code with your application to calculate checksums:

#### Sample Checksum Calculator Code

```C++
const int CRCTable[] =

# Understanding Payment Flows

To initiate a payment or to tokenize a card, your application sends a Do Payment Transaction (DPT) command to the unattended device. The device then captures and encrypts the customer's payment card data and sends an authorization request to the CardPointe Gateway. 

To refund, void, or inquire on an existing payment, your application must use the CardPointe Gateway API to interact directly with the CardPointe Gateway.

The following topics describe each of these payment flows in detail.

#### Authorize and Capture a Payment

To authorize and capture a payment, your application interacts with the unattended device as follows:

1) Your application sends a DPT sale (`"paymentType":1`) request.

    For example, to capture a payment for $1, your application sends the following command: 

    `*PAE|DPT|CMD|1|{"OrderID":"A1B2C3", "paymentAmount":100, "paymentType":1, "paymentUser":"John"}|03878|*!PAE!*`

    See the DPT Request Syntax for detailed information on the PAE command format and supported commands.

2) The PAE requests the payment card data from the unattended device.
3) The PAE retrieves the encrypted card data from the device, and forms an authorization (with capture) request to the CardPointe Gateway, including the Merchant ID and API Authorization Key provisioned for the device.
4) The PAE transmits the auth request and returns the response data from the CardPointe Gateway to your application. See the DPT Response Syntax for detailed information on the response data.

    **Note**: _The response includes the_ `processorReference` _(the CardPointe Gateway_ `retref` _or retrieval reference number) for the transaction. You must store this value in order to look up, refund, or void the transaction._

5) Your application presents a receipt or (or decline response) to the customer using the response data returned to your application.

#### Authorize a Payment with Delayed Capture

To authorize a payment, but delay the capture, your application interacts with the unattended device as follows:

1) Your application sends a DPT Authorization-only (`"paymentType":6`) request. For example: `*PAE|DPT|CMD|1|{"OrderID":"A1B2C3", "paymentAmount":100, "paymentType":6, "paymentUser":"John"}|50955|*!PAE!*`

    See the DPT Request Syntax for detailed information on the PAE command format and supported commands.

2) The PAE requests the payment card data from the unattended device.
3) The PAE retrieves the encrypted card data from the device, and forms an authorization request to the CardPointe Gateway, including the Merchant ID and API Authorization Key provisioned for the device.
4) The PAE transmits the auth request and returns the response data from the CardPointe Gateway to your application. See the DPT Response Syntax for detailed information on the response data.
5) Your application can use the `cardToken` and `processorCode` (authcode) from the response to make a delayed capture request using the CardPointe Gateway API.

#### Refund a Payment without Reference (Forced Credit)

<!-- theme: danger -->
> **Note**: _Your merchant account must be enabled to process forced credit transactions._

To refund a payment using the customer's card, instead of using the retrieval reference number (`retref`), your application interacts with the unattended device as follows:

1) Your application sends a DPT refund (`"paymentType":3`) request.

    For example, to refund a $1 payment, your application sends the command `*PAE|DPT|CMD|1|{"orderId":"A1B2C3", "paymentAmount":100, "paymentType":3, "paymentUser”:”John”}|09282|*!PAE!*`

    **Note**: _The_ `PaymentAmount` _value must be positive._

    See the DPT Request Syntax for detailed information on the PAE request format and supported payment types.

2) The PAE requests the payment card data from the unattended device.
3) The PAE retrieves the encrypted card data from the device, and forms a negative authorization request to the CardPointe Gateway, including the Merchant ID and API Authorization Key provisioned for the device.
4) The PAE transmits the auth request and returns the response data from the CardPointe Gateway to your application. See the DPT Response Syntax for detailed information on the response data.
5) Your application presents a receipt or (or decline response) to the customer using the response data returned to your application.

#### Refund or Void a Payment with Reference

To refund or void a transaction, you use the `processorReference` value returned in the DPT response. 

Your application makes a CardPointe Gateway API refund or void request, using the `processorReference` value in the `retref` field in the request.

See the refund and void endpoint descriptions for detailed information.

#### Validate and Tokenize a Payment Card

To validate and tokenize a payment card, your application interacts with the unattended device as follows:

1) Your application sends a DPT tokenization (`"paymentType":5`) request. For example: `*PAE|DPT|CMD|1|{"OrderID":"A1B2C3", "paymentAmount":100, "paymentType":5, "paymentUser":"John"}|02519|*!PAE!*`

    **Note**: _The_ `paymentAmount`, `paymentType`, _and_ `paymentUser` _fields are required to preserve the message format, but the values are ignored for a tokenization request._

    See the DPT Request Syntax for detailed information on the PAE command format and supported commands.

2) The PAE requests the payment card data from the unattended device.
3) The PAE retrieves the encrypted card data from the device, and a tokenization request to CardSecure.
4) The PAE returns the response data , including the token, from CardSecure to your application. See the DPT Response Syntax for detailed information on the response data.
5) Your application can use the token to make a payment request or create a customer profile using the CardPointe Gateway API.

## Handling Offline Payments

The CardPointe Unattended device requires a persistent network connection in order to send and receive transaction data. If the device loses its network connection, it can temporarily operate in Offline Mode. In Offline Mode, the device forms and securely stores payment requests, then forwards the transactions to the web payment application for processing, once the network connection is successfully re-established. 

<!-- theme: danger -->
> Accepting payments in Offline Mode can help to prevent customer-facing business disruptions; however these payments are **not** authorized and processed until the device is reconnected. Therefore, you may incur the risk of receiving payment declines after you have provided goods or services.

### Configuring Offline Mode

Offline Mode is disabled by default, and must be individually configured for each device. Additionally, the following settings must be configured:

- **Maximum Amount** - The maximum amount threshold for each offline transaction (in pennies). 
- **Maximum Time** - The maximum amount of time for which offline transactions will be permitted (in hours).

If your application sends a DPT request with an amount that exceeds the configured maximum, or after the configured offline timeframe has expired, the DPT response returns an error.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Additionally, it is strongly recommended that you include a unique `orderId` value in every DPT request. You can use the `orderId` to reconcile offline transactions using the CardPointe Gateway API. See Reconciling Offline Transactions for more information.

> Contact isvsupport@cardconnect.com for assistance configuring these settings.

### Processing Offline Transactions

When your application sends a DPT command while the device is in Offline Mode, the payment is automatically approved, and returns DPT response code `020D` as well as an offline receipt payload. Because offline transactions are not authorized until they are processed, this offline receipt includes fewer details than a normal receipt.

When the device is in Offline Mode, your application can send the GOT (Get Offline Transactions) command to check for any currently stored transactions (identified by timestamps) and the total amount of all stored transactions. See the GOT description for more information.

Additionally, the GCS (Get Current Status) command provides information on currently stored transactions, and identifies when the device is actively processing offline transactions. See the GCS description for more information.

When the unattended device re-establishes the network connection, the device temporarily remains in Offline Mode while it creates an offline batch and transmits the offline transactions to the web payment application for processing. Once all stored transactions are processed, the device exits Offline Mode and resumes normal operation.

> It can take up to five (5) minutes for the device to begin transmitting offline transactions once the network connection is restored.

### Reconciling Offline Transactions

To reconcile offline transactions, you can use either of the following CardPointe Gateway API requests:

- Use the `inquireByOrderid` request to retrieve a transaction's status by its unique `orderId`, if specified in the DPT command.
- Use the `settlestatByBatchSource` request to retrieve the entire batch of offline transactions for a given day.

#### Using inquireByOrderid to Retrieve A Single Offline Transaction

To reconcile individual offline transactions, you can use the CardPointe Gateway APIs `inquireByOrderid` endpoint to retrieve transaction status and retrieval reference number (retref). See the Inquire By Order ID description in the CardPointe Gateway API for additional information on the inquireByOrderid request and response.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> In order to use the `inquireByOrderid` request, you must specify a unique `orderId` value in each DPT payment request. 

#### Using settlestatByBatchSource to Retrieve Offline Batches

To reconcile offline batches, you can use the CardPointe Gateway API's `settlestatByBatchSource` endpoint to retrieve the settlement status and retrieval reference number (`retref`) for all offline transactions in a given day's offline batch.

> You can only use the `settlestatByBatchSource` request to retrieve the batch details after the batch has closed, typically at the end of the business day.

When the network connection is restored, the device makes a request to the CardPointe Gateway to create a new batch with a unique `batchsource` identifier in the format `<hsn>-<yyyymmdd>` (for example, `103T662929-20210224`). This batch remains open for the remainder of the business day, and is used to capture all offline transactions for that day.

The `settlestatByBatchSource` request requires the `merchid` and unique `batchsource`. The response returns the total number of sales and refunds, the total amount, and a `txns` array, with the details for each transaction in the batch. 

The `salesdoc` field in the response is populated by the `orderId` sent in the initial DPT request, which can be useful in reconciling 

See Using the settlestatByBatchSource Endpoint in the CardPointe Gateway Developer Guides for more information.

# CardPointe Unattended API

The CardPointe Unattended API provides a simple ASCII messaging format for communicating with the device over the serial/USB connection.

All commands and responses share a common format, and every field in the message string is required to preserve the expected format and sequence of fields.

```
*PAE|<message key>|<message type>|<response code>|{JSON data object}|<checksum>|*!PAE!*
```

<!-- theme: warning -->
> - Every message must include these seven fields.
> - Each field in the message is pipe-delimited (`|`). Back-to-back delimiters must be used to specify an empty field (`||`).

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `*PAE` | The header, required for all messages. |
| `<message key>` | A 3-character alpha-numeric string that indicates which message your application is sending or receiving. <br> One of the following values: <br> <br> **CPT**- Cancel Payment Transaction <br> **DPT**- Do Payment Transaction <br> **GCS** - Get Current Status <br> **GOT** - Get Offline Transactions <br> **GTI** - Get Terminal Info <br> **PAE** -  Internal messages and errors <br> **RBT** - Reboot Terminal |
| `<message type>` | A 3 or 4-character alphanumeric string that indicates the message type. <br> One of the following values: <br> <br> **CMD**- Indicates that the message is a command, or request. <br> **RESP** - Indicates that the message is a response. |
| `<response code>` | An 8-character hexadecimal string that indicates a successful response or error. See Response Codes for a list of all possible response and error codes. <br> <br> This field is ignored for **CMD** messages; however if null, it must be included as an empty field (`||`) to preserve the message format. |
| `{JSON data object}` | Any additional data passed in the message, in a JSON object containing `"key":"value"` pairs. <br> <br> For a DPT command, the data field is used to specify the transaction details (for example the type and amount of the transaction). <br> <br> For a DPT, GCS, GOT, or GTI response, the data field returns the response data in a JSON object. <br> <br> **Note**: _If the message does not include any additional data, this field must be included as an empty field_ (`||`) _to preserve the message format._ |
| `<checksum>` | An alpha-numeric string used to authorize each request. The checksum must be a decimal value calculated using the ASCII command string up to the delimiter preceding the checksum as a base value, and using the CRC-16 algorithm. <br> <br> For example, for a GTI command, use the following section of the command string as the base value: `*PAE|GTI|CMD|||`. The CRC-16 checksum calculated for this value is `14392`, which you include in the command as follows: `*PAE|GTI|CMD|||14392|*!PAE!*`. <br> <br> See the Sample Checksum Calculator to generate the checksum, or develop your own utility. |
| `*!PAE!*` | *!PAE!* is the message terminator, used to indicate the end of the message.

## CPT (Cancel Payment Transaction)

The CPT request cancels an in-flight DPT command, if the customer has not yet inserted their card. If the customer has already inserted their card and the read was successful, then you must void the transaction.

### CPT Request Syntax

```
*PAE|CPT|CMD|1||<checksum>|*!PAE!*
```

> Fields 4 and 5 are not used, but **must** be present to preserve the expected message format.

#### Sample CPT Request

```json
*PAE|CPT|CMD|1||40451|*!PAE!*
```

### CPT Response Syntax

```
*PAE|CPT|RESP|<response code>||<checksum>|*!PAE!*
```

#### Sample CPT Response

```json
*PAE|CPT|RESP|00000000|Payment canceled|46408|*!PAE!*
```

Where `<response code>` is `00000000` for a successful response, or one of the following errors:

| Hex Value | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| 01A4	| Payment cannot be canceled.
| 01A5	| No active payment.
| 01A6	| Request to cancel payment failed.

See Response Codes for more information.

## DPT (Do Payment Transaction)

The DPT request retrieves encrypted payment card data from the device, to tokenize and process a payment on the CardPointe Gateway.

The DPT command supports the following transaction types, as specified by the `paymentType` in the command:

- Sale, or authorization and capture.
- Authorization only, without capture.
- Refund without reference (forced credit), or negative authorization and capture.
- Tokenization only, no authorization or capture.

### DPT Request Syntax

```
*PAE|DPT|CMD|1|{payment details}|<checksum>|*!PAE!*
```

where `{payment details}` is a JSON object that includes the following parameters:

> Parameters are not case-sensitive.
>
> Parameters in **bold** are required.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| orderId | string | A unique order ID used to identify the transaction. This value is an alphanumeric string with a maximum of 19-characters. <br> <br> You can use the order ID to get information on a transaction using the CardPointe Gateway API inquireByOrderid endpoint. <br> <br> **Note**: _If you include an order ID it must meet the following requirements:_ <br> <br> - _The order ID must be a unique value. Using duplicate order IDs can lead to the wrong transaction being voided in the event of a timeout._ <br> - _The order ID must not include any portion of a payment account number (PAN), and no portion of the order ID should be mistaken for a PAN. If the order ID passes the Luhn check performed by the CardPointe Gateway, the value will be masked in the database, and attempts to use the order ID in an inquire, void, or refund request will fail._
| **paymentAmount** | numeral | The amount of the transaction, in cents (the decimal is implied). <br> <br> **Note**: `paymentAmount` _must be a positive number._ |
| **paymentType** | numeral | The type of transaction. Must be one of the following values: <br> <br> **1** - Sale <br> Authorizes and captures the amount specified in the request. <br> <br> **3** - Refund (Forced Credit) <br> Authorizes and processes a refund in the amount specified in the request. <br> **Note**: _The merchant account must be configured to process forced credits._ <br> <br> **5** - Tokenization Only <br> Validates the card and returns a CardSecure token, which can be used to process a payment or create a customer profile, using the CardPointe Gateway API. <br> <br> **6** - Authorization Only <br> Authorizes the amount specified in the request and returns a CardSecure token, but does not capture the transaction. You can use the token to capture the authorized amount using the CardPointe Gateway API. |
| **paymentUser** | string | A unique identifier for the user or attendant initiating the transaction. This can be useful to identify transactions processed during different shifts. <br> <br> **Note**: `PaymentUser` _is required; however you can specify a static value in all DPT requests if this data is not applicable to your environment._ |

For example, to send a payment request for $1.00, send the following command:

#### Sample DPT Request

```json
*PAE|DPT|CMD|1|{"orderId":"TEST01", "paymentAmount":100, "paymentType":1, "paymentUser":"John"}|54215|*!PAE!*
```

### DPT Response Syntax

The DPT command returns a series of responses throughout the transaction process.

In general, DPT responses are returned in the following format:

```
*PAE|DPT|RESP|<response code>|{JSON response object}|<checksum>|*!PAE!*
```

Where `{JSON response object}` contains either:

- an LCD code and LCD message used to provide user interaction details during the transaction process. 
- the authorization response details, once the transaction has completed.

#### Understanding DPT Transaction Flow and Responses

DPT response code `02010000` is used to pass along a series of LCD messages, which can be presented to the user on the POS application. These LCD messages are included as a `{JSON response object}` in the data field of the response.

For example, when the application sends the DPT command, the device responds to the application with the following response, to prompt the user to insert the card:

`*PAE|DPT|RESP|02010000|{"LCD_Code":13,"LCD_Msg":"INSERT CARD"}|59993|*!PAE!*`

The following examples illustrate some common LCD messages. See LCD Codes and Messages for a complete list.

#### Sample DPT LCD Message Responses

```json

# Response Codes

The payment application includes a series of response codes that provide status and error information within the response message. 

Response codes are generated as 8-character hexadecimal strings, in the format: `<general code>` `<detail code>`, where 

- `<general code>` is a 4-character value representing the general response information.
- `<detail code>` is a 4-character value representing a more detailed explanation. The `<detail code>` value can be null, represented as `0000`, if no detailed response is available.

For example, the following response code indicates that the DPT command was successful, and the device is waiting for the customer to insert a card:

```
*PAE|DPT|RESP|01F40000|{"cardToken":"9475419822370119","processorMsg":"No error"}|08414|*!PAE!*
```

In this example, `01F4` represents the general DPT successful status response and `0000` represents no additional detailed information.

The following table describes each possible response code, and the corresponding decimal value, returned in the previous version of the application:

## Hex to Decimal Response Code Converter

You can use the following C/C++ code snippet to convert the hexadecimal response codes into decimal values, if needed to retain backwards compatibility with your application.

#### Sample Response Code Converter

```C++
void DecodeResponse(char* responseCode, unsigned short* detailCode, unsigned short* generalCode)
{
    unsigned long tmp = (unsigned long)strtol(responseCode, NULL, 16);
    *generalCode = tmp >> 16;
    *detailCode = (unsigned short)(0x0000FFFF & tmp);
}
```
