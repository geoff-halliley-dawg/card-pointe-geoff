# Overview

The CardPointe Gateway is integrated with ACH Payment Services from Fiserv (also known as Fiserv ACH).

This guide provides information for using the CardPointe Gateway API to accept ACH payments from your application.

> Fiserv ACH currently supports the US Dollar (USD) currency only.

# What's New?

## Date Updated: 9/20/2021 

This guide has been updated with additional information and clarifications on ACH Reversals. 

## Date Updated: 3/13/2021 

The CardPointe Gateway API includes two additional fields for ACH authorization requests:

- `achDescription`

    An optional description for the transaction, truncated to a maximum of 10 characters.

    For ACH reversals, you **must** specify this field as `Reversal`, as required by NACHA guidelines. See ACH Reversals for more information.

- `achEntryCode`

    Determines the type of ACH transaction. If omitted, this value is determined by the CardPointe Gateway based on the merchant's configuration.

    One of the following values:

    - `CCD` - B2B payment with a signed company agreement on file.

    - `PPD` - Recurring payment, with a signed customer agreement on file.

    - `TEL` - Phone payment (call center), with the customer's recorded verbal consent on file.

    - `WEB` - Web or mobile payment, with a customer's web authorization or agreement on file.

    **Note**: _For refunds, this field is converted to either_ `CCD` _or_ `PPD` _depending on the merchant account configuration._

See Making an ACH Authorization Request for more information.

# Understanding ACH Rules and Regulations

Before you begin, you should review and understand the rules and regulations concerning ACH payments.

The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) governs the industry-standard requirements that all merchants and service providers must abide by. The NACHA Operating Rules and Guidelines is a formal standard that outlines specific rules for accepting and processing ACH payments and data security guidelines to protect sensitive account information. As a merchant, it is your obligation to review and abide by these guidelines. To obtain a copy of the NACHA Operating Rules and Guidelines, see https://www.nacha.org/rulesyourway.

Additionally, the ACH Payment Services Operational Guidelines Overview provides helpful information for understanding and complying with the NACHA rules and guidelines.

# Processing ACH Transactions

To process ACH payments on the CardPointe Gateway, you use the CardPointe Gateway API to make authorization requests just like you would for credit card transactions. The authorization request supports all of the required fields for processing ACH checking or savings account transactions, including sales and refunds. 

Unlike credit card payments, when a customer authorizes an ACH payment, the funds are withdrawn directly from his or her bank account. This process can take several days, so you should include a monitoring process in your integration to verify the status of the transaction.

To accept ACH payments, you must capture and handle the customer's bank account and routing number. While you can capture this information and pass it directly to the CardPointe Gateway in an authorization request, it is a best practice to instead capture this information and tokenize it using a CardSecure-integrated web form.

## Account Validation

For WEB debit transactions (consumer payments originated on the internet or a mobile device or automatically debited), the account validation service checks the account and routing numbers against a list of known-good accounts to verify that the account can be used to complete the transaction.

If the account is successfully validated, the transaction is approved and settled. If the account is closed, unknown, or has been previously flagged, the transaction is declined in real time and must be reattempted with an alternate payment method. In the event of a decline, the CardPointe Gateway returns a declined authorization response with one of the following reasons:

- `"Declined: bank account failed validation"`
- `"Declined: bank account previously failed validation"`

<!-- theme: warning -->
> See the Fiserv ACH Account Validation support article for detailed information on the account validation service and requirements.

## ACH Reversals

An ACH reversal can be performed to correct an erroneous transaction (for example, the wrong bank account was debited). 

Similarly to a refund, a reversal credits the funds back to the debited account; however, a reversal is only acceptable in the event of an error by the initiator of the original transaction (merchant) and can only be performed by the initiator to correct the error. NACHA enforces strict rules and requirements for processing reversals, including:

- The amount (`amount`) of the reversal must exactly match the amount of the original transaction
- The SEC code (`achEntryCode`) in the reversal request must match the value used in the original transaction.
- The ACH Description (`achDescription`) must be `Reversal` to identify the transaction as a reversal.

See the following article for important updates to the NACHA rules and enforcement for ACH reversals:

## Using a Web Form to Gather and Tokenize ACH Payment Data

To ensure the security of your customers' data, it is recommended that you use a customer-facing web form, integrated with CardSecure, to capture and tokenize bank account and routing information.

When using a web form to capture and tokenize customer bank account information, include separate fields for the routing number and account number. Send these fields in a CardSecure tokenization request in the format

`"account" : "<routing number>/<account number>"`

For example:

`"account" : "123456789/1234123412341234"`

CardSecure returns a token representing the ACH account information, which you can then use to make an authorization request to the CardPointe Gateway.

## Making an ACH Authorization Request

The following table describes the authorization request fields that you must include when processing an ACH payment:

> - Fields in **bold** are required.
> - Underlined fields can be saved to a profile, if `"profile" : "y"` in the request. See the Profile endpoint description for more information.
>   
>     **Note**: _If the authorization request fails or is declined, the profile is not created._
>
> - Most fields in the authorization request correspond to columns on the CardPointe application's Transactions table. See the CardPointe Web App User's Guide for more information.

## Verifying ACH Transactions

ACH transactions typically take several business days to process and settle, therefore, it is a best practice to periodically check the status of the transaction to ensure that it is successfully processed and that you are credited for the authorized amount.

You can use the CardSecure Gateway API to programmatically verify the transaction status using the funding and inquire service endpoints.

### Using the Funding Endpoint

> To use the funding endpoint to retrieve your ACH funding data, you must use your Fiserv ACH MID and API credentials associated with this MID.
The funding endpoint provides additional useful information for ACH transactions. Specifically, you can use the funding endpoint to retrieve an ACH return code (`achreturncode`), which provides additional information for rejected ACH transactions.

To use the funding endpoint, you make a request using the merchant ID and the date of the funding event that included the transaction. The funding endpoint returns an array of transaction details for that date.

Use the `retref` for the ACH transaction to locate it in the txns node of the response data. For ACH transactions, the response includes an `achreturncode` field that includes a specific code that explains the reason for the rejection.

The following table describes the possible ACH return code values.

### ACH Return Codes

The following codes are returned when an ACH transaction is rejected. 

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| R01 | Insufficient funds
| R02 | Bank account closed

| R13 | RDFI not qualified to participate
| R14 | Representative payee deceased or unable to continue in that capacity
| R15 | Beneficiary or bank account holder
| R16 | Bank account frozen
| R17 | File record edit criteria
| R18 | Improper effective entry date
| R19 | Amount field error

| R81	| Non-Participant in Cross-Border Program
| R82	| Invalid Foreign Receiving DFI identification
| R83	| Foreign Receiving DFI Unable to Settle

### Using the Inquire Endpoint

The inquire endpoint provides information on completed authorizations.

You can use the inquire endpoint if you have the retrieval reference number (`retref`) from the authorization response. If you don't have the `retref`, but you included a unique order ID in the authorization request, then you can use the inquireByOrderId endpoint instead.

The inquire response includes a settlement status (`setlstat`) field that displays the settlement status of the transaction. Note that the settlement status initially displays "Queued for Capture" for ACH transactions, and the value is updated once the batch is transmitted. If `"setlstat" : "rejected"` you can use the funding endpoint to gather more detailed information.
